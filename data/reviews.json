            "content": "Christopher Nolan’s \"Interstellar,\" about astronauts traveling to the other end of the galaxy to find a new home to replace humanity’s despoiled home-world, is frantically busy and earsplittingly loud. It uses booming music to jack up the excitement level of scenes that might not otherwise excite. It features characters shoveling exposition at each other for almost three hours, and a few of those characters have no character to speak of: they’re mouthpieces for techno-babble and philosophical debate. And for all of the director’s activism on behalf of shooting on film, the tactile beauty of the movie’s 35mm and 65mm textures isn’t matched by a sense of composition. The camera rarely tells the story in Nolan’s movies. More often it illustrates the screenplay, and there are points in this one where I felt as if I was watching the most expensive NBC pilot ever made. And yet \"Interstellar\" is still an impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan's work melted away. I’ve packed the first paragraph of this review with those objections (they could apply to any Nolan picture post \"Batman Begins\"; he is who he is) so that people know that he’s still doing the things that Nolan always does. Whether you find those things endearing or irritating will depend on your affinity for Nolan's style.",

            "content": "Like the great space epics of the past, Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar” distills terrestrial anxieties and aspirations into a potent pop parable, a mirror of the mood down here on Earth. Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” blended the technological awe of the Apollo era with the trippy hopes and terrors of the Age of Aquarius. George Lucas’s first “Star Wars” trilogy, set not in the speculative future but in the imaginary past, answered the malaise of the ’70s with swashbuckling nostalgia. “Interstellar,” full of visual dazzle, thematic ambition, geek bait and corn (including the literal kind), is a sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret. Trying to jot down notes by the light of the Imax screen, where lustrous images (shot by Hoyte van Hoytema and projected from real 70-millimeter film) flickered, I lost count of how many times the phrase “I’m sorry” was uttered — by parents to children, children to parents, sisters to brothers, scientists to astronauts and astronauts to one another. The whole movie can be seen as a plea for forgiveness on behalf of our foolish, dreamy species. We messed everything up, and we feel really bad about it. Can you please give us another chance?",

            "content": "Say this much for “Interstellar”: It takes muchness to a new level. Ask a handful of viewers what they think of Christopher Nolan’s science-fiction adventure story — starring a perfectly cast Matthew McConaughey as a space cowboy blessed with equal parts swagger and shamanistic depth — and they will rightfully wonder which movie you’re referring to: The outer-space epic that tries mightily to give such precursors as “2001: A Space Odyssey” and “Gravity” a run for their O-rings in sheer scale and ambition? The provocative, sometimes ponderous, meditation on environmental ruin, intellectual freedom and the demise of manifest destiny? The mawkish daddy-needs-to-save-the-world-now melodrama? The pulverizing, near-constant sonic boom of the sound design modulated by periods of haunting, airless silence?",

            "content": "\"Mud\" is set in Arkansas as best friends Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) discover a boat stuck in a tree on a deserted island and accidentally stumble onto the whereabouts of a mysterious man known only as Mud (Matthew McConaughey). Mud is waiting for his girlfriend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), but is also stranded because he's a wanted man by not only the police but also bounty hunters. Even though the boys are warned that Mud is more venomous in nature than he may seem, Ellis and Neckbone decide to assist Mud in trying to get off the island, reunite with Juniper, and successfully avoid the men who are looking for him. There's this thick, muggy atmosphere with \"Mud\" that's established right when it starts; dense fog lingering on the water, sun shining through the trees, and antlers hanging from the ceiling. This is a way of life most people aren't familiar with. You find yourself immediately drawn to Mud wearing boots with crosses in the heels, an intricate snake tattoo, the only valuable things on him being his shirt and his pistol, his dirty scruffiness, and chipped front tooth appearance. The man has some of the most elaborate stories any individual could possibly have and whoever he's telling them to is pulled in as soon as he opens his mouth. That boat in that tree may be \"a hell of a thing,\" but Mud is one hell of a character.",

            "content": "2012 was a busy, busy year for Matthew McConaughey; it was a year that saw the Texan-born actor make no less than four films: Bernie, Killer Joe, Magic Mike and this film Mud. And it could be argued that it's in this film he gives the best performance for out of the four. That's not to say he gives the best performance in the film however, as that accolade has to go to the film's two younger actors, Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland. In the quiet, wet backwaters of Arkansas, two young boys enjoy the pleasure that living surrounded by water can bring. Fourteen year olds Ellis (Sheridan) and Neckbone (Lofland) take a small boat onto the river and go exploring. They venture further afield than usual and end up on a small island. Whilst managing to avoid the snakes there, they come across a larger boat, suspended high above in the trees. Their curiosity obviously gets the better of them and they climb the trees and jump aboard. It looks pretty beat up and deserted, until Ellis notices that there's some fresh food inside the cabin. Knowing that someone must be living there, they soon high-tail it out of there. They soon come across a man, whose skin is darkened by the sun, covered in tattoos. His name is Mud (McConaughey) and he is indeed the one living in the boat. He eventually tells them his story: he's come back to this area to meet someone – a woman called Juniper (Reece Witherspoon) – who he is completely in love with. Unfortunately, due to circumstances, he can't just waltz into town and meet her, as he's a wanted man. But the boys, particularly Ellis, take pity on him, and decide to do whatever it takes to get these two lovers back together again. But as they soon discover, the fact that Mud's a wanted man, doesn't help their cause.",
